# Wharf Roadmap

## Vision

Make CMS security as reliable as containerized infrastructure by separating
administration from runtime.

## Current Status: v1.0.0 (Foundation) ✅

Production-ready sovereign web hypervisor with:

- ✅ Offline admin (Wharf) + read-only runtime (Yacht) architecture
- ✅ File sync with BLAKE3 integrity verification
- ✅ Remote integrity verification via SSH
- ✅ Fleet management with TOML configuration
- ✅ eBPF XDP firewall with nftables fallback
- ✅ Distroless containers (Chainguard)
- ✅ OpenLiteSpeed + LSAPI PHP
- ✅ Prometheus metrics endpoint
- ✅ Let's Encrypt SSL automation
- ✅ SQL query filtering proxy
- ✅ WordPress adapter
